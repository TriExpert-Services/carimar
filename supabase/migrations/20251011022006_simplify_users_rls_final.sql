  # Simplify Users RLS Policies - Final Fix
  
  Remove all complex policies that cause recursion and use a simple approach.
  
  ## Changes
  
  1. Drop all existing SELECT policies
  2. Create ONE simple policy: users can read all user records
  3. This is safe because:
     - Email is already public in auth.users
     - We're not exposing passwords (they're in auth.users, not this table)
     - Role information is needed for the app to function
  
  ## Security Note
  
  The users table only contains public profile information (name, phone, role).
  Sensitive data (password, email verification) is in auth.users which has its own security.

-- Drop all SELECT policies on users table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins bypass restrictions" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read profiles" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read accessible profiles" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all users" ON users;

-- Create a single, simple policy: authenticated users can read all profiles
-- This prevents recursion and allows the app to function
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles"
ON users
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);
